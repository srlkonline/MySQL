# MySQL Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains projects focused on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets using MySQL. The objective is to prepare raw data for analysis and uncover meaningful insights through structured queries and statistical exploration.



# Data Cleaning:

-Handling missing, null, or inconsistent values

-Standardizing data formats (e.g., dates, categories, text)

-Removing duplicates and outliers

-Filtering and normalizing records for consistency



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Descriptive statistics (mean, median, count, etc.)

-Distribution analysis and trend identification

-Grouped aggregations and segmentation

-Time series summaries and growth trends

-Joining multiple tables for richer insights



# Use Cases:

-Customer segmentation and behavior analysis

-Sales and revenue trends

-Product and inventory insights

-Employee and HR data exploration

-Operational performance analysis



# Tools & Techniques Used:

-MySQL – Primary language for data querying and transformation

# SQL Queries:

-SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY

-JOIN, UNION, subqueries, and CTEs

-Window functions for running totals, ranks, etc.

-Date functions for time-based analysis



Data Export to Excel / Power BI / Python (optional) – For advanced visualization or modeling

ERD and Schema Diagrams – For understanding relationships in complex databases
